# java-design-patterns
The `java-design-patterns` project aims to explain well-known design patterns in Java as well as to demonstrate some examples. 

## Goal
We, software developers, inevitably need to spend more time on maintaining the existing system,
rather than developing the initial system. The reasons are many. But we expect to have new requirements every so often.

Since Java is the Object-Oriented (OO) language, there are advantages that can prevent some unexpected changes on the existing code.
Updating existing code may cause bugs or waste time to update more code to align with the new code. 
Thus, designing a system well is important to not touch the existing code even though we have to meet a new requirement.

Design patterns can give us guidelines to design a system more flexible, i.e., reusable, extensible and maintainable so that it can cope with change.

# The Observer Pattern
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## The Observer Pattern from Scratch
While in some cases you can make use of Java's built-in support, in a lot of cases it is more flexible to build your own.
